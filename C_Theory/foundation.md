## What is program?
- set of logically grouped instruction is a program
Types of programming language?
- LL -> MC_L & ASM_L
- ML
- HL
- 4GL
- 5GL

## Software(collection of program)
2 type
- application software
- system software

## Linker
- it is a type of system software which is used to link
object code & library to make executable files.
## Loader

## Files that are created for each c program

## Variable
- variable is a type of container which is used to hold a perticular type of value and this type is defined by its datatype
eg - int x;

*X is a variable of integer type so it can hold only int type value at a time*

*whenever a var is defined, memory is allowed for it [2 bytes for integers]*

*value that was present in those 2 bytes is knows as garbage value*

## 3 basic terms related to a variable
## defination :
defination means memory allocation i.e whenever variable is defined , memory is allocated for it;

eg. int x; {2 byte memory is allocated for var x}

## declaration
declaration means information to compile above datatype of variables

for eg.
int x; {here info is given to compiler that data type of x is int}

## initialization

1st value which is assigned to a variable
